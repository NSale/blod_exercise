                            <p>There is nothing like the views you get when hiking in the mountains and forests!
                            And I wasn't even prepared for what happened whilst I was enjoying the view!

        <h2>What I do</h2>
        <p>
            I love programming, I love to help others and I enjoy exploring new technologies in general!
        </p>
        <p>
            My goal is to keep on growing as a developer - and if I could help you do the same, I'd be very happy!
